<b>About Punjab PSC  :</b>The Joint Public Service Commission (PSC), the precursor of the Punjab Public Service
                   Commission known as PPSC, with its writ running from the Khyber Pass to the Jamuna near 
                   Delhi, was born at Lahore on 01/05/1937. In the wake of the Partition, the Punjab Public
                   Service Commission resurged in February, 1948, at Shimla with its revised jurisdiction 
                   extending over the then province of East Punjab. Following the merger of the States of 
                   Punjab and Pepsu, it shifted to Patiala on 01/11/1956. On 01/11/1966, its territorial 
                   jurisdiction again decreased due to the formation of the States of Haryana and Himachal
                   Pradesh.
